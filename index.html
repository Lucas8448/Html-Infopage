                <p>Online scams have become a common phenomenon. The internet is full of fake
                    websites, social media posts and emails claiming that they are there to help you or they
                    have something that you can receive. People need to be aware of the dangers of online fraud
                    in order to protect themselves from being deceived. Anyone using the internet should take
                    precautions so as not to fall victim to fraudulent activities. Scammers create websites and
                    apps that look legitimate but are actually designed to steal visitors personal information.
                    These pages look like normal web pages but contain hidden malicious code designed to infect
                    users' devices with malware. This data is then sold to various criminal organizations who
                    use it to send illegal scams directly to your home. People should avoid revealing their
                    contact information or submitting sensitive business information to questionable websites.
                    Additionally, users should never enter passwords or payment details when registering for any
                    online service. Malicious websites and applications will never use this information to
                    contact you directly. Instead, the data is sold to others who intend to defraud that person.
